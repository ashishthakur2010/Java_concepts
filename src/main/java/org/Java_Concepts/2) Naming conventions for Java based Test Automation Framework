2) Naming conventions for Java based Test Automation Framework: https://lnkd.in/grhFquC3

Scaling a Test Automation Frameworks require different factors, one such crucial factor is managing “Naming Conventions”. This one helps our code to be readable and reduces code complexity.
Why Naming conventions matter?
1) Consistent naming conventions helps in code readability and makes it easier for whole team to understand the code base.

2) Maintenance becomes easier, as we can easily understand where the dependencies, constants etc. needs to be updated.

3) Newer team members, can go through the code base directly and do not require to get a documentation or discussion with other team members.

Naming Conventions for
Packages:
Keep all package names in lowercase, separated by periods (.). Start with your company’s domain in reverse, followed by clear and concise module names.

Example:

com.automationtech.test.pages
com.automationtech.test.utils
Classes:
Use PascalCase for class names. Each class name should be noun-based and clearly define what the class does.

Example:

LoginPage, TestBase, BrowserFactory
Methods:
Use camelCase for methods, and start each name with an action verb describing its behavior.

Example:

loginToApplication(),
clickSubmitButton()
Variables:
Follow camelCase for variable names. These should be self-explanatory to reflect their purpose.

Example:

String username,
int maxRetries
Constants
Use ALL_CAPS and underscores (_) for constants, which should be declared static final.

Example:

public static final int DEFAULT_TIMEOUT = 30
Interfaces
Use PascalCase, and avoid prefixing interfaces with ‘I’. Interface names should describe a capability, often as nouns or adjectives.

Example:

WebDriver,
TestRunner
Creating Test Classes:
End your test class names with Test. The class name should represent the functionality being tested.

Example:

LoginTest,
SearchFunctionalityTest
Test Methods:
Follow camelCase for test methods, which should describe the action, scenario, and expected result.

Example:

loginWithValidCredentials(),
verifyHomePageTitle()
Utilities and Helpers
Keep utility package names logical and avoid deep nesting.

Example:

com.automation.test.utils
Loggers
Use camelCase for log variables, often reflecting the class being logged.

Example:

private static final Logger log = LoggerFactory.getLogger(LoginPage.class);
Conclusion:
By following these naming conventions, you ensure that your automation framework will not only be readable and maintainable but will also scale seamlessly as your projects grow.
